# Vue 3 - Vite

### What is Vue.js 3?

Vue.js 3 is the latest major version of the Vue.js JavaScript framework. Vue.js is a progressive framework for building User Interfaces - Ui and is widely used in developing Single Page Applications - Spa and creating reusable components.

### Some of the Key Features of Vue.js 3 Include:

1. **Improved Reactivity:** Vue 3 introduces a more efficient and powerful reactivity system than its predecessor. This means that changes to data are automatically reflected in the UI without requiring manual manipulations of the Dom.

2. **Composition Api:** Vue 3 introduces a new composition Api that makes it easier to reuse and organize code by breaking down a component's logic into smaller, more manageable functions.

3. **Portals:** Portals allow developers to render components in a different place in the Dom, which can be useful for implementing certain functionality, such as modal overlays.

4. **Performance Improvements:** Vue 3 has achieved significant performance improvements, making applications faster and more efficient.

5. **Static Typing:** Support for TypeScript has been improved, providing a more robust and type-safe development experience.
